# AI Builder licensing information

Before you can use AI Builder, you have to obtain a license, except for features that are in preview release status. You can obtain a trial license to try AI Builder free for 30 days. 

## AI Builder trial licenses

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

AI Builder relies on environment security and Common Data Service security roles and privileges to grant access to AI features in PowerApps. For more information, see [Security overview](/power-platform/admin/wp-security).

An AI Builder trial license enables you to use  AI Builder for free for the duration of the trial period. Find more information about trial environments [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/trial-environments) 

- A trial license enables you to use all AI Builder model types and functionalities for 30 days free of charge. [Sign up here](Sign-up-link-when-available) 
- After your trial period expires, you canâ€™t create new models, or update existing ones until you purchase an AI Builder license. [Purchase here](Purchase-link-when-available) 
- Ai Builder model types that are in preview release status  are free to use, and you do not need to start a trial license if you are only using preview release features.

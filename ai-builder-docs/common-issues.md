# Common issues and resolutions for AI Builder 

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This article lists some common issues that you might encounter while using AI Builder. Where applicable, workarounds are provided.

1. **AI Builder not set up correctly in your environment**

    If you are using an environment that was created before AI Builder was first released, in some rare cases AI Builder may have not been set up correctly. To work around this issue, [create a new environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/create-environment) and AI Builder should be correctly installed in that new environment. If you must use that particular environment, [contact support](#) for more options.

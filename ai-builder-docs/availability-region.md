# Feature availability by region

AI Builder initially released in Europe and the United States. Other regions continue to be added, however the availability and release status of AI Builder's features varies by location.

## Which region does my AI Builder subscription belong to?

Your AI Builder models are deployed in the region that hosts your Common Data Service environment. For example, if your environment is created in the Europe region, the AI Builder models you train and use are deployed in Europe data centers, and are subject to the availability status for Europe.  

## Availability and release status of features by region

The table shows which AI Builder features are available in each region, as well as the release status (general availability (GA) or preview) for each feature.

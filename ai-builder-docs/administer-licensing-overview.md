# AI Builder licensing overview

AI Builder is licensed as an add-on to your PowerApps or Microsoft Flow licenses. This means you can start your AI Builder trial after you have a PowerApps or Microsoft Flow license that allows you to create a Common Data Service environment. You can use preview features in AI Builder without obtaining a license. If your organization wants to obtain an AI Builder licence, an administrator for your organization has to purchase AI Builder capacity and allocate it to your environment in the [Power Platform Admin Center](/power-platform/admin/signup-for-powerapps-admin).

# Use your binary classification model in a model-driven app

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You should review [Model-driven apps overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview) topic in PowerApps Docs before you perform the steps here.  

We go through the process of creating a model driven app that can sort your records by the probability value in the AI model output.

1. Sign in to [PowerApps](https://web.powerapps.com/), select **Apps** from the menu, and then select **Create an app** at the top of the screen. Then, select **Model-driven** in the drop-down menu, give the app a name and select **Done**.
2. On the **App Designer** configuration screen, you need to do two things:
    - Create a view of your entity that contains the predicted fields from prediction output.
    - Add the view to the site map.
3. Select **Entities** on the **Components** menu, select your entity, and then select **Back**.
4. Select **Save** at the top of the screen so that you don't lose your progress when you create a view, then select **Views** under **Entity view** and select **Create New** on the **Components** tab.
5. Select **Column Attributes â€“ Primary Entity** on the **Components** tab, and then select the fields generated by prediction output.  
6. Select **Save And Close**, give your view a name, and then select the view you just created. Then, select **Save** again. 
7. Select the pencil icon next to **Site Map**, rename **New Group** appropriately. 
Select **New Subarea** and select **Entity** as the **Type**, and then select your entity from the **Entity** dropdown menu.
8. Select **Save And Close** and then select **Publish**.
9. Select **Play**. Your output should look something like this.

Congratulations, you've just created your first model-driven app using the binary classification AI model prediction output.

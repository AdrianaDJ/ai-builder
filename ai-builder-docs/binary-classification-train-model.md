# Train and publish your binary classification model

Before you can use your binary classification model, you have to train it to perform the way you want. After you train your model, publish it to make it available to other people.

## Train

After you've selected your data fields, select **Next** to view a summary of  training information. Then, select **Train** to train your model.

> [!NOTE]
> Training takes time, so you can stay on the page and wait, or you can close the page and come back later.  

## Publish

After the model is trained, youâ€™ll be able to [evaluate](manage-model.md#evaluate-your-model) your model performance results. Then, [publish](publish-model.md) your model to start running predictions. After that, predictions run daily.

## binary classification run

To start a new binary classification run, go to the model settings page and select **Run now**.

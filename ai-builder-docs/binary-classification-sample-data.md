# Use sample data to do binary classification

To explore the possibilities of binary classification in AI Builder, you can get started by building and training an binary classification model using sample data provided by Microsoft.

## Get the sample data

You can [configure your new environment](build-model.md) to deploy sample data automatically when you create it, or you can use the AI Builder samples stored [here](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/ai-builder), and follow the instructions in the [Data preparation](binary-classification-data-prep.md) topic to import the sample data into your Common Data Service environment, then follow the [Create a binary classification model](create-binary-classification-model.md) instructions to create an AI model using the sample data.

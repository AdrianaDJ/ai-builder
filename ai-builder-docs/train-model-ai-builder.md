# Train a model in AI Builder

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]


Before you can use a model, you must first train it. After you train a model, you can [publish your model](publish-model-ai-builder.md) to make it available to other people.

## Train model
When you create a model in AI Builder, you configure it to fit the needs of your business. Each time you save changes to your model in AI Builder, you are saving your progress as a draft. After you finish making changes, you confirm the settings with which you want to train your model, and then select **Train** to begin training.

The training process may take a few minutes, depending on the AI model type and the size of the training data. This process happens in the background, so you can safely leave the page and come back later.

After you train your model for the first time, you have access to a **Details** page where you can [manage your model](manage-model-ai-builder.md) and depending on your AI model type, view your modelâ€™s performance results.

On the **Details** page,  training results appear under the **Last trained version** section.

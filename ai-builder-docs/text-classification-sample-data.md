# Use sample data to do text classification 

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

To explore the possibilities of text classification in AI Builder, you can get started by building and training an text classification model using sample data. 

## Get the sample data

Download [AIBuilder_Lab.zip](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/blob/master/ai-builder/labs/AIBuilder_Lab.zip) file, which contains text classification sample images and labels. 

> [!NOTE]
> The **AIBuilder_Lab.zip** file also contains sample files for working with other AI Builder model types, as well as some hands-on-labs that you can use to learn more about AI Builder. More information about the contents of the zip file  is available [here](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/ai-builder/labs), or in the **readme.txt** file contained in the zip file.

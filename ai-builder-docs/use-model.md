# Use model 

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

When you publish your model, you can use it across the Power Platform to create end-to-end solutions that meet your business needs. In this topic, you'll learn all of the different ways you can use your model.

## How can I use my model?

Once you have published your model, you will see a **Use model** button in the **Performance** section. This will open a pane listing all of the different options where you can use your model. These options will differ based on your AI model type.

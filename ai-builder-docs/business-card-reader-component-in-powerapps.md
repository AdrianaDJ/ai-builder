# Use the business card reader component in a canvas app

The business card reader component takes a photo or loads an image from the local device, and then scans it to find a business card. If it detects a business card, it extracts the information it finds.

> [!NOTE]
> - This component isn't supported in Internet Explorer.
> - For information about canvas apps, see [What are canvas apps in PowerApps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/getting-started)?

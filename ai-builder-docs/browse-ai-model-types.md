# Browse AI model types

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Build a model based on an AI model type for a specific scenario, such as recognizing your products on an image, and then train and publish the model for use in your business. 
To create a model, sign in to [PowerApps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com). In the left navigation bar, select **AI Builder (preview)** > **Build**, and then choose the model type that matches what you want to do.

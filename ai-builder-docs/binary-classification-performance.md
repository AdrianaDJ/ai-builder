# Understand binary classification model performance

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

After each training, AI Builder uses the test data set to evaluate the quality and accuracy of the new model. A summary page for your model shows your model training result, including a **Performance** score.  

## Performance score calculations

AI Builder calculates the performance score for your model based on the precision and recall of the prediction results:

- **Performance score**: This is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall scores. It balances both scores for an imbalanced class distribution. Performance score values are between 0â€“100 percent. Generally, the higher the performance score, the better your model performs.
- **Precision**: The fraction of correct predictions among all the positive predictions.
- **Recall**: The fraction of correct predictions among all true positive cases.

For more information, go to [Evaluate your model](manage-model.md#evaluate-your-model).

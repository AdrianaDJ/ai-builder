# Build a model

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

In AI Builder, you are guided through each step of the process.

## Prerequisites
AI Builder requires use of [Common Data Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro). Common Data Service is the data platform that comes with PowerApps and allows you to store and manage business data. It’s the platform on which Dynamics 365 applications are built; if you’re a Dynamics customer, your data is already in Common Data Service. 

- For more information about the Common Data Service, go to Common Data Service in PowerApps Docs.
- For information about how to import data into Common Data Service, go to  Add data to an entity using Power Query in PowerApps Docs.
## Get started
To get started, sign in to PowerApps. 
1.	In the left navigation bar, under **AI Builder (preview)** select **Build**.
2.	Under **Make your own AI model**, select an AI model type.
If you don’t see any AI model types, see [Onboarding/opt in and opt out]() for more information.
3.	Enter a model name, and then select **Create**.

# What is AI Builder?

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

AI Builder is a new Power Platform capability that allows you to easily automate processes and predict outcomes to improve business performance. AI Builder is a turnkey solution that brings the power of Microsoft Artificial Intelligence (AI) through a point and click experience. Using AI Builder, you can build AI without having coding or data science skills. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - AI Builder is a a preview feature.
> - [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](./includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)] 

Using AI is easy thanks to integration with PowerApps and Microsoft Flow. Follow these steps: 
1. **Choose AI model type**: Select your business problem from a growing set of AI turnkey solutions. 
1. **Connect data**: Select your business-specific data from Common Data Service. AI Builder (preview) does the hard work for you thanks to Common Data Model. 
1. **Tailor your AI model**: Filter your data, set scheduling, and tweak the AI model with business decisions that affect how AI performs. 
1. **Train your AI model**: Training is an automatic operation where AI Builder (preview) “teaches” your AI model how to resolve your business problem (e.g.: recognize your products on an image) thanks to your business data and tailoring. When trained, your AI model can generate insights, such as the result of a prediction or the list and count of objects detected in an image. 
1. **Use your AI model’s insights**: Use the insights without any coding skills across Power Platform to create end-to-end solutions to your business problems.  For example, create a Flow that automates document processing or an app in PowerApps that predicts whether a supplier will be out of compliance. 

We  cover each of these steps in the individual AI model type sections.

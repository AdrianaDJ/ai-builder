# Overview of prebuilt AI models

AI Builder prebuilt models help you add intelligence to apps and flows without having to gather data and then build, train, and publish your own models. For example, you can add a component in Power Apps based on prebuilt model that recognizes contact information from business cards.  You can use  a prebuilt model in Power Automate to analyze whether customer feedback was positive or negative.

Prebuilt models are available in Power Automate and Power Apps, depending on the model. The following prebuilt models are currently available in AI Builder:

|Model |Availability  |
|---------|---------|
|Business card reader   |   Power Automate and Power Apps     |
|Key phrase extraction  |    Power Automate    |
|Language detection  |    Power Automate    |
|Text recognition      |    Power Automate    |
|Sentiment analysis     |    Power Automate    |

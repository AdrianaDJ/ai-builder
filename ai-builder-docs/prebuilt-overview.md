# Overview of prebuilt AI models

AI Builder includes a set of prebuilt models that allow to add intelligence to your apps and flows without having to gather data, build, and train your models. For example, you can add a component in PowerApps based on prebuilt model that recognizes contact information from business cards, or use  a prebuilt model in Flow to analyze whether customer feedback was positive or negative.

The prebuilt models are available in Microsoft Flow and/or PowerApps, depending on the model. The following prebuilt models are currently available in AI Builder:

|Model |Availability  |
|---------|---------|
|Business card reader   |    Microsoft Flow and PowerApps     |
|Key phrase extraction  |     Microsoft Flow    |
|Language detection  |     Microsoft Flow    |
|Text recognition      |     Microsoft Flow    |
|Sentiment analysis     |     Microsoft Flow    |

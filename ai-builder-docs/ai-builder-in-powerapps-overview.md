Adding AI Builder features to your Canvas applications is possible through a set of AI Builder components available in the Canvas Studio.

These components appear in the **Insert** tab when you build your Canvas app in PowerApps.

There are 3 components  available:
 - [Business card reader](business-card-reader-component-in-powerapps.md)
 - [Form processor](form-processor-component-in-powerapps.md)
 - [Object detector](object-detector-component-in-powerapps.md)

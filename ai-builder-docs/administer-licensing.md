# Preview features and trial licenses

Want to get started using AI Builder? Use premium features for a limited time with a trial license, or use preview features without obtaining a license at all.

## Preview features

AI Builder features that are in preview release status are free to use. You do not need to obtain a license to use preview features in AI Builder.

## Trial licenses

An AI Builder trial license enables you to use  AI Builder for free for the duration of the trial period.

What you get with an AI Builder trial license:

- The ability to create and use AI models in any PowerApps environment (trial or production), because the AI Builder trial license is applicable at the user level, not at the environment level.
- Access to store  your AI model results in Common Data Service.
- The capability to add intelligence to your organization by utilizing your AI model results in PowerApps and Microsoft Flow.

> [!NOTE]
> Your trial licenses is specific to a user, not an environment. If you already have an environment with PowerApps license (free or paid), you can use that environment or create a new one for your AI Builder trial.

For more information about trial licenses:

- [PowerApps](https://signup.microsoft.com/Start?sku=powerapps)
- [Microsoft Flow](https://preview.flow.microsoft.com/)

### After the trial expires:

- Trial environments expire after 30 days.
- Once you purchase an AI Builder license, the usage will be limited to environments where the administrator allocates AI capacity.

> [!NOTE]  
> These restrictions apply only to model types that have been released to  general availability. Model types in preview release status will remain available without a license until they are released for general availability.

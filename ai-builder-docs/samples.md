# Start using AI Builder with sample data

Don't have any data of your own to create a model? No problem! We've got you covered. You can [configure your new environment to deploy sample data automatically](build-model.md) when you create it, or you can download sample data and follow the instructions to work with it.

## Get sample data

There is sample data available for each model type, and instructions with how to work with it. Select one of these options to get started.

- [Create a model using form processing sample data](\ai-builder-docs\form-processing-sample-data.md)
- [Create a model using object detection sample data](\ai-builder-docs\object-detection-sample-data.md)
- [Create a model using prediction sample data](#)
- [Create a model using text classification sample data](#)

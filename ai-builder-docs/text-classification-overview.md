# Preview: Overview of text classification model

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The volume of text data is increasing exponentially for organizations. Channels such as email, documents, social media, and others contribute increasing amounts of text data. This data carries valuable information that—when extracted and acted upon—helps you provide better products and services to your customers. Dealing with this ever-increasing data is often time-consuming and error prone, and sometimes leads to missed business opportunities and costs.

Text classification is one of the fundamental natural language processing (NLP) problems. With text classification, you can identify text entries with tags to be used for things like:

- Sentiment analysis
- Spam detection
- Customer request routing
- Other business needs

Automate and scale your business processes with AI Builder text classification in [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/) and [Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/). AI Builder models help free your employees to act on new insights. Use the results as an input for other AI capabilities, like subscription user churn and predictive analysis. AI Builder learns from your previously labeled text items, and enables you to classify unstructured text data stored in Common Data Service into your own business-specific categories.

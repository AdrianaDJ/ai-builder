# Overview

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Textual data volume is growing exponentially in organizations through multiple channels such as emails, documents or social media. This data carries a lot of valuable information that - when extracted and acted upon - helps you provide better products and services to your customers. Dealing with this ever-growing data can be time-consuming and error prone, leading to missed business opportunities and costs.

Text Classification is one of the fundamental NLP (Natural Language Processing) problems. It allows tagging of text entries with tags or labels. It can be used for sentiment analysis, spam detection and routing customer requests.

You can use AI Builder text classification with [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com/) and [PowerApps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/) to automate and scale your business processes, freeing up time for your employees to act these insights. It can also be used as an input for other AI capabilities such as subscription user churn, predictive analysis. AI Builder can learn from your previously labeled text items, and enable you to classify unstructured text data stored in Common Data Service into your own business-specific categories.

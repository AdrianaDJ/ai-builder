# AI Builder in PowerApps overview

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

To use you AI Builder models in PowerApps, build a [model-driven app](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview), or use AI Builder components in the canvas studio to add an AI model to a [canvas app](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/getting-started).

There are 3 components  available:
 - [Business card reader](business-card-reader-component-in-powerapps.md)

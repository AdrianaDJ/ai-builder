# AI Builder in PowerApps overview

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

AI Builder comes with:
- A ready-to-use business card reader available in canvas as well as in [model-driven apps](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview). 
- Additional canvas components to leverage your AI Builder form processing or object detection models in PowerApps [canvas apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/getting-started). These components are available in the canvas studio.

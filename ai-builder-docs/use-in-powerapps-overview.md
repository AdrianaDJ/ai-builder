# AI Builder in PowerApps overview

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Use AI Builder models in PowerApps by building a model driven app, or by adding an AI model to an app using a set of AI Builder components in the canvas studio.

These components appear in the **Insert** tab when you build your Canvas app in PowerApps.

There are 3 components  available:
 - [Business card reader](business-card-reader-component-in-powerapps.md)
 - [Form processor](form-processor-component-in-powerapps.md)
 - [Object detector](object-detector-component-in-powerapps.md)

# AI Builder in PowerApps overview

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

To use your AI Builder models in PowerApps, build a [model-driven app](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview) or use AI Builder components in the canvas studio to add an AI model to a [canvas app](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/getting-started).

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Canvas studio screen](media/canvas-studio.PNG "Canvas studio screen")

These components appear in the **Insert** tab when you build your canvas app in PowerApps.

Three components are available:

 - [Business card reader](business-card-reader-component-in-powerapps.md)
 - [Form processor](form-processor-component-in-powerapps.md)
 - [Object detector](object-detector-component-in-powerapps.md)

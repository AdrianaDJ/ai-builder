## Microsoft Flow

If you want to use your trained model in Microsoft Flow, you can find more information in [Use text classification model in Microsoft Flow](text-classification-model-in-flow.md).


## What if the model is not writing new tag suggestions? 



 - Check that you didn’t exceed the number of runs for your Microsoft Flow subscription.
 - Turn off the Common Data Service run setting, and then turn it back on.

## Microsoft Flow
If you want to use your trained model in Flow, you can find more information [here](text-classification-model-in-flow.md).


## What if the model is not writing new tag suggestions? 
 - Check that you didnâ€™t  exceed the number of Flow runs for your subscription. 
 - Turn off the Common Data Service run setting, and then turn it back on.

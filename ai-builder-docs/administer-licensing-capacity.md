# Paid licenses and capacity allocation

First, you have to purchase AI Builder capacity add-on for your PowerApps or Microsoft Flow licenses. Then, an administrator has to allocate that capacity to any PowerApps environment where you want to use AI Builder.

## AI Builder paid licenses

After your AI Builder trial license expires:

- You have to [purchase a license](/power-platform/admin/signup-for-powerapps-admin) to continue using your AI models
- An administrator has to assign AI Builder capacity to any environment where you want to use AI Builder.
- You can't create or modify AI Builder models, and no new inference will be possible when the trial expires if you don't purchase a license.

## Allocate AI Builder capacity

Because AI Builder is licensed as a capacity add-on to your existing PowerApps and Microsoft Flow licenses, an administrator has to allocate capacity for AI Builder to the environment before you can use it. Information about how to allocate capacity in the Power Platform Admin Center is available [here](/power-platform/admin/).
